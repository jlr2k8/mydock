# MyDock (DRAFT)

## Intro
MyDock is a bash based application to build and host Docker environments locally. It includes official 'joshlrogers'
Docker repo source files, an example Apache/PHP/MySQL application and a directory for your custom projects. Within a
few steps, you can create and start up local development environments. Your PHP/Apache web application mount your
codebases' working copies so you can see live changes as you develop your web app.
